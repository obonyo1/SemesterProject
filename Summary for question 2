                                      Summary
Peterson's N Algorithm ensures that multiple processes can safely share a resource without conflicts.
The flags and turn arrays implement the logic for mutual exclusion and bounded waiting.
Visualization helps understand the flow: yellow for waiting, green for accessing, and white for idle.
The GameManager.cs ties everything together, creating processes and simulating their behavior.
